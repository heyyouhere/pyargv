#Python argv parser

Yet another argv parser written by me. Just to make my own life easier.

##Features
1. Supports flags and function-flags (with input).
2. You can set some flags as nessasary, python will raise excpetion if none was included.
3. All checking is applied: no function-flags without input and so on.
